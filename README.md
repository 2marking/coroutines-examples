# Kotlin Coroutines

In this repository, we are working on the design for supporting coroutines in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org).

## Navigate

* [Informal description of the current proposal](kotlin-coroutines-informal.md)
* [Example code](examples) (this repo can be cloned and opened as a project in IntelliJ IDEA)
* [Issues](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-coroutines/issues)

## Review/Propose

Please feel free to review the documents and examples and share your feedback, concerns and proposals in the [issues](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-coroutines/issues) (please look for existing issues first to avoid duplicates).

Some highlighted issues:
* Arguments **against** implementing this feature are discussed [here](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/issues/3)
* How similar features work in **other languages** is discussed [here](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/issues/2)

Your input is very important for us. Use cases and experience reports about other languages/tools with similar functionality are especially appreciated. Final decisions will be taken by the Kotlin team, but we do our best to cover as many use cases as possible.
