# Kotlin Coroutines

In this repository, we are working on the design for supporting coroutines in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). 
It is logically a part of [KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP).

## Review/Propose

Please feel free to review the documents and examples and share your feedback, concerns and proposals in 
the [issues](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-coroutines/issues) (please look for existing issues first to avoid duplicates).

Your input is very important for us. Use cases and experience reports about other languages/tools with similar 
functionality are especially appreciated. Final decisions will be taken by the Kotlin team, but we do our best to 
cover as many use cases as possible.
